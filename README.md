## Model Comparison and Observing Overfitting
Four models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

| Model                 | Train Time (seconds) | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | CV Mean Accuracy | CV Std Dev |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 81.01                | 0.878          | 0.877         | 0.874            | 0.009      |
| Decision Tree         | 2.32                 | 0.991          | 0.960         | 0.944            | 0.002      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors   | 4.75                 | 1.000          | 0.909         | 0.913            | 0.008      |

The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy and AUC but required the longest training time. The Decision Tree and KNN models also performed well, with the Decision Tree showing strong accuracy and KNN demonstrating high recall for the positive class. Logistic Regression, while slightly lower in performance, remains a robust and interpretable model.

## Feature Importance Analysis
Permutation feature importance was analyzed for SVM and Logistic Regression models due to the lack of overfitting evidence.

### SVM Feature Importance
Top features:
- `num_emp.var.rate`
- `num_duration`
- `num_cons.price.idx`
- `num_nr.employed`
- `num_euribor3m`

![SVM Feature Importance](images/permutation_feature_importance_svm.png)

### Logistic Regression Feature Importance
Top features:
- `num_nr.employed`
- `num_cons.conf.idx`
- `num_cons.price.idx`
- `num_euribor3m`
- `num_emp.var.rate`

![Logistic Regression Feature Importance](images/permutation_feature_importance_lr.png)

## Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)
PDPs help understand the relationship between features and the target variable.

### Key Insights
1. **Call Duration**: Moderate durations (6-8 minutes) increase subscription likelihood.
2. **Number of Contacts During Campaign**: Fewer contacts are better.
3. **Days Since Last Contact**: More days since the last contact increases likelihood.
4. **Number of Previous Contacts**: Fewer previous contacts are better.
5. **Employment Variation Rate**: Lower rates are better.
6. **Consumer Price Index**: Moderate values are better.
7. **Consumer Confidence Index**: Moderate values are better.
8. **Month of Contact**: Specific months like March, June, September, and December might be less favorable.

### Business Implications
1. **Optimal Call Duration**: Maintain calls between 6 and 8 minutes.
2. **Contact Frequency**: Reduce the number of campaign contacts.
3. **Re-contact Timing**: Allow more days between contacts.
4. **Previous Contacts**: Minimize to avoid contact fatigue.
5. **Economic Indicators**: Monitor to identify favorable conditions.
6. **Month of Contact**: Adjust timing strategies based on further data validation.

### Comparison with the Paper Findings
- **Model Performance**:
  - Both my findings and the paper highlight SVM as the best performer.
- **Key Features**:
  - Both analyses emphasize the importance of call duration and month of contact.
- **Insights**:
  - Align on the effectiveness of fewer contacts and strategic timing for higher subscription rates.

### Recommendations Moving Forward

1. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**:
   - **Interaction Features**: Develop interaction terms between important features, such as `num_duration` and `num_previous`.
   - **Temporal Features**: Create features like recency of contact (`recent_contact` if `num_pdays` < 7).
   - **Aggregate Features**: Calculate mean/median call duration for each customer.
   - **Binning Features**: Bin continuous variables like call duration into categories (e.g., short, medium, long).
   - **Lag Features**: Generate lag features for temporal data, like the difference in days between consecutive contacts.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Use frequency encoding for categorical variables to retain distribution information.
   - **Macro-Economic Trends**: Create moving averages for economic indicators like `num_emp.var.rate`.

2. **Model Improvement**:
   - **Ensemble Methods**: Combine models using techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting or possibly neural network to capture its hidden complexity.

3. **Business Strategy Optimization**:
   - **Call Duration Management**: Focus on maintaining call durations within the optimal range of 6-8 minutes to maximize subscription likelihood.
   - **Contact Frequency Reduction**: Reduce the number of campaign contacts to avoid customer annoyance and improve effectiveness.
   - **Strategic Re-Contact Timing**: Plan re-contacts after optimal periods (e.g., 20-30 days) and focus on months that show higher success rates based on historical data.


By implementing these recommendations, the marketing campaigns can become more efficient, targeted, and effective, leading to higher subscription rates and better resource management.

## Conclusion
The SVM model is recommended for its superior performance and actionable insights. The use of permutation importance and PDPs enhances the model's interpretability, guiding strategic decisions for optimizing marketing campaigns. Further feature engineering can improve model performance and provide deeper insights into customer behavior.
