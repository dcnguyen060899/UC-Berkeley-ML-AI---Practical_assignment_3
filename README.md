   - Highlights positive and negative relationships between numerical features.
   - `duration` and `y_encoded` have a moderate positive correlation, suggesting longer calls are associated with higher subscription rates.

4. **Education vs Subscription**:
   ![Education vs Subscription](education_subscription_distribution.png)
   - Higher subscription rates are observed among customers with university degrees.
   - Customers with lower educational levels tend to have lower subscription rates.

5. **Job vs Subscription**:
   ![Job vs Subscription](job_subscription_distribution.png)
   - Job types like 'admin.' and 'blue-collar' have lower subscription rates.
   - Higher subscription rates are observed for job types like 'management' and 'retired'.

6. **Subscription Distribution**:
   ![Subscription Distribution](subscription_distribution.png)
   - Majority of the customers did not subscribe.
   - There is a significant class imbalance with far fewer subscribers.

7. **Contact Communication Type vs Subscription**:
   ![Contact Communication Type vs Subscription](contact_communication_type_subscription_distribution.png)
   - Higher subscription rates are seen for cellular contacts compared to telephone.
   - The majority of contacts were made via cellular phones.

8. **Housing Loan vs Subscription**:
   ![Housing Loan vs Subscription](housing_loan_subscription_distribution.png)
   - Customers without housing loans have higher subscription rates.
   - Most customers, irrespective of subscription status, do have housing loans.

9. **Marital Status vs Subscription**:
   ![Marital Status vs Subscription](martial_status_subscription_distribution.png)
   - Single customers have higher subscription rates compared to married or divorced ones.
   - Married customers form the largest group but have lower subscription rates.

10. **Personal Loan vs Subscription**:
    ![Personal Loan vs Subscription](personal_loan_subscription_distribution.png)
    - Higher subscription rates are observed for customers without personal loans.
    - Most customers, especially those who did not subscribe, do not have personal loans.

## Model Comparison and Observing Overfitting
Four models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

| Model                 | Train Time (seconds) | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | CV Mean Accuracy | CV Std Dev |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression   | 81.01                | 0.878          | 0.877         | 0.874            | 0.009      |
| Decision Tree         | 2.32                 | 0.991          | 0.960         | 0.944            | 0.002      |
| K-Nearest Neighbors   | 4.75                 | 1.000          | 0.909         | 0.913            | 0.008      |
| Support Vector Machine| 875.95               | 1.000          | 0.996         | 0.992            | 0.002      |

### Observations
- SVM shows the highest accuracy but requires more training time.
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models have strong performance with faster training times.
- KNN and Decision Tree model indicates potential overfitting.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the best choice for optimizing marketing campaigns due to its superior predictive performance and ability to generalize well on new data, despite its higher computational cost.

## Feature Importance Analysis
Permutation feature importance was analyzed for SVM and Logistic Regression models due to the lack of overfitting evidence.

### SVM Feature Importance
Top features:
- `num_emp.var.rate`
- `num_duration`
- `num_cons.price.idx`
- `num_nr.employed`
- `num_euribor3m`

![SVM Feature Importance](permutation_feature_importance_svm.png)

### Logistic Regression Feature Importance
Top features:
- `num_nr.employed`
- `num_cons.conf.idx`
- `num_cons.price.idx`
- `num_euribor3m`
- `num_emp.var.rate`

## Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)
PDPs help understand the relationship between features and the target variable.

### Key Insights
1. **Call Duration**: Moderate durations (6-8 minutes) increase subscription likelihood.
2. **Number of Contacts During Campaign**: Fewer contacts are better.
3. **Days Since Last Contact**: More days since the last contact increases likelihood.
4. **Number of Previous Contacts**: Fewer previous contacts are better.
5. **Employment Variation Rate**: Lower rates are better.
6. **Consumer Price Index**: Moderate values are better.
7. **Consumer Confidence Index**: Moderate values are better.
8. **Month of Contact**: Specific months like March, June, September, and December might be less favorable.

### Business Implications
1. **Optimal Call Duration**: Maintain calls between 6 and 8 minutes.
2. **Contact Frequency**: Reduce the number of campaign contacts.
3. **Re-contact Timing**: Allow more days between contacts.
4. **Previous Contacts**: Minimize to avoid contact fatigue.
5. **Economic Indicators**: Monitor to identify favorable conditions.
6. **Month of Contact**: Adjust timing strategies based on further data validation.

## Conclusion
The SVM model is recommended for its superior performance and actionable insights. The use of permutation importance and PDPs enhances the model's interpretability, guiding strategic decisions for optimizing marketing campaigns. Further feature engineering can improve model performance and provide deeper insights into customer behavior.
